# ingredients-refined


This repository contains code to clean and preprocess raw recipe ingredients. The main goal is to convert messy ingredient strings into structured Python lists for modeling.

`["1/4 cup sugar", "2 cups flour", "1/2 tsp baking powder"]` -->  `["sugar", "flour", "baking powder"]`
